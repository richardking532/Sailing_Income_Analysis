# Sailing_Income_Analysis
Project analyzing the impact of a sailing charter company switching from a dual-income model to a charter-only model

This is my first real-world project using R. One of my family members runs a sailboat charter business, so I offered to take a look at his revenue reports and try to answer any business questions he might have. For years, he has offered his customers two services: charters and lessons. In early 2023 though, he decided he no longer wanted to keep teaching lessons because they forced him to spend so many nights away from his family. Concerned about the negative impact this might have on his business, he asked me to investigate and see what I could find. See the .pdf for the full report!

In regards to my code, I slowly worked on this project over the course of a couple of months due to other events going on in my life. During this time, I was taking a lot of R courses online, so you might notice some strange things as my coding abilities developed. I added new libraries and techniques as I learned them, but I decided not to necessarily go back through my entire code to update everything. I'd rather close out this project and spend my time working on new ones.

Unfortunately, I cannot share my data sources, as I want to maintain my family member's personal and business privacy; therefore, you will not be able to run this code yourself. I have anonymized my report as well.

Any feedback is greatly appreciated. I'm eager to continue learning and developing my abilities!
